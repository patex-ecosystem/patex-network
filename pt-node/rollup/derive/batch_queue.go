// when the sequence window has passed. This is a very stateful stage.

// It receives batches that are tagged with the L1 Inclusion block of the batch. It only considers
// batches that are inside the sequencing window of a specific L1 Origin.
// It tries to eagerly pull batches based on the current L2 safe head.
// Otherwise it filters/creates an entire epoch's worth of batches at once.
//
// This stage tracks a range of L1 blocks with the assumption that all batches with an L1 inclusion
// block inside that range have been added to the stage by the time that it attempts to advance a
// full epoch.
//
// It is internally responsible for making sure that batches with L1 inclusions block outside it's
// working range are not considered or pruned.
